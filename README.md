# checkers
Checkers game using React Typescript

New Checkers React project made with React/Typescript ONLY!

The main feature is the King Checker, he can move on diagonal lines,
but if we have jump kill, then we can only move only 1 cell further from the target checker.

Multi-jumping feature is present in all types of checkers (standart and King).
