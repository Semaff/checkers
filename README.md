Checkers game using React Typescript

New Checkers React project made with React/Typescript ONLY!

The main feature is the King Checker, he can move on diagonal lines,
but if we have jump kill, then we can only move 1 cell further from the target checker.

Multi-jumping feature is present in all types of checkers (standart and King).
If you can't move, this is means you do invalid move, it can happen if you have jump moves, and you're trying to do single move.
